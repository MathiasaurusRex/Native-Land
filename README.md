Native-Land
===========

A web app with Google Maps API for mapping Aboriginal nations along with placenames in local languages.

Rebooted from the other branch - needed to be rethought considerably.

<h2>The Idea</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A way to access Aboriginal languages of BC on the go, from the field, etc</li>
  <li>Highly user-friendly and accessible in devices (Javascript, iOS app, Android)</li>
  <li>Resources only from Aboriginal nations</li>
  <li>Language resources pointing to First Nations Language Map, plus any pronounciation guides online</li>
  <li>Local placenames</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a bunch of local place names</li>
<li>Make marker icons disappear at certain zoom level; have them appear on click of language zone</li>
<li>Add a legend for language areas - possible to do mouseover with KLM any simple way? Other solutions?</li>
<li>Create iOS app that can access the same database</li>
<li>Try to go around and add more local names to areas and places</li>
<li>Streetview? (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/streetview-service)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This app is simply meant to sit on top of Google maps and provide a map of native land. This is starting in British Columbia, Canada, but if I establish a good framework it should work anywhere.</p>
<p>I got the idea for this app while driving along the Sea-to-Sky highway between Vancouver and Squamish in BC. Many of the road signs had the local language place names for rivers, towns, and more, in brackets underneath the English names. I thought "why isn't the English in brackets...?"</p>
