<p>This app is simply meant to sit on top of Google maps and provide a map of native land. This is starting in British Columbia, Canada, but if I establish a good framework it should work anywhere.</p>
<p>I got the idea for this app while driving along the Sea-to-Sky highway between Vancouver and Squamish in BC. Many of the road signs had the local language place names for rivers, towns, and more, in brackets underneath the English names. I thought "why isn't the English in brackets...?"</p>
