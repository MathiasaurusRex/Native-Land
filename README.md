Native-Land
===========

A web app with Google Maps API for mapping Aboriginal nations along with placenames in local languages.

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start gathering icons for bands across BC, size them similarly, save resources below</li>
<li>Gather good maps, upload them for overlay option, then start mapping the zones</li>
<li>Contact bands or locals about place names in local languages, conduct field research</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features to add</h2>
<ul>
<li>Different points for Aboriginal bands across Lower Mainland or Okanagan</li>
<li>Mapping rivers, lakes, beaches, etc, with local language names</li>
<li>Adding pronounciation guides, links to language apps, language guides</li>
<li>Adding historical information; customs, architecture, art, residential schools, reserves, links</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This app is simply meant to sit on top of Google maps and provide a map of native land. This is starting in British Columbia, Canada, but if I establish a good framework it should work anywhere.</p>
<p>I got the idea for this app while driving along the Sea-to-Sky highway between Vancouver and Squamish in BC. Many of the road signs had the local language place names for rivers, towns, and more, in brackets underneath the English names. I thought "why isn't the English in brackets...?"</p>
<p>In BC, there are many, many different Aboriginal bands and languages. I want to learn how to not only read placenames and languages as I see them across BC, but to become familiar with the different areas of tribal territory. These languages are old here, and the land knows them.</p>
<p><strong>I don't want to work on this alone. I know I need to be careful. So I hope to find a lot of help.</strong></p>
